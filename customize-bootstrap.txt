To customize the bootstrap we want auto prefixer  and sass 
after that we can do the customize , we can change anything like primary color secondary color as per out website design.
npm install sass we  can install globally also
npm install postcss-cli autoprefixer --> in the css foler
so then after creating sass and css file we can change the variable sass and we can compile it in css with sass bootstrap.sass bootstrap.css
after the generated file is going to have all the customization
